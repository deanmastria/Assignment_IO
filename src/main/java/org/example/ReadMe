Criteria Met

# Reads input from both files
# Merges content of input files and maintains original order of integers
# Writes and properly formats contents into merged.txt output file
# Identifies common integers and stores them in separate data structure
# Writes common integers in common.txt output file
# All 3 Exceptions and try-catch blocks used


# Task 1

## File structuring
## Resources: directory contains input and output directories for input files, output for writing files
## Changed Main.java to MergeAndFindCommonIntegers
## Added input and output folders to resources
## Created input1 and input2
## readIntegersFromFile: Method to read integers from specific files and
## error handling to check if files exist, have content and contain correct number formatting

# Task 2

## New ArrayList called mergedList: Created to store merged integers from both input files
## Merged the Lists: Used mergedList.addAll(list2) to merge the files while maintaining order

## Task 3

## HashSet: Used to find common integers between the files
## Testing: Added duplicate integers to input files for testing

#Task 4

## commonSet: Created using new HashSet<>(list1) to store common integers
## commonList: Passed commonSet to a new ArrayList to create a list of common integers
## Writing to File: Used writeIntegersToFile method to write commonList to common.txt

#Task 5

## Enhanced Error Handling: Continued to handle exceptions for file I/O operations and invalid number formats

### files not found, filepath is correct, removed .txt from `List<Integer> list1 = readIntegersFromFile("src/main/resources/input/input1.txt");`
